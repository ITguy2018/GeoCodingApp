Geo-Coding App.

This is an Python app using the Flask library. The idea behind this is to import a csv file you may have and it will automatically add the longitude and latitude coodinates as long as the csv file as an "Address" column filled out with the correct address.

I did style the layout and look of this app but the overall idea and logic is from an Udemy course by Ardit Sulce.

I used this tool to create a interactive map in my other repo: https://github.com/ITguy2018/VermontMoviesDashboard
